<h3>[How To Make Tiktok Ramen]</h3>
<p><strong>Tiktok ramen, a personal favourite is basically instant noodles stir fried with butter, garlic, egg, and soy sauce. It's saucy, sweet, full of umami, and really good.Tiktok ramen is where you use instant ramen noodles, ditch the seasoning packet, and make your own sauce. Unlike soup-y ramen, Tiktok ramen is a soup-less ramen, kind of like mazemen or sesame noodles. Ramen noodles are tossed in a garlic butter soy brown sugar sauce, cooked with an egg and finished with a sprinkle of everything bagel seasoning.</strong></p>

<h2>How To make Tiktok ramen.</h2>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Cook your instant ramen.</strong> Don’t overcook it – mushy noodles are a travesty. Instant ramen should have an al dente bite. Pop the noodles into boiling water, set a timer, use a pair of chopsticks to loose the them up, and when the time is up, instantly drain them and set them aside. Pro tip: if you’re a true noodle lover, cook the noodles slightly less than the suggested cooking time, they will cook up a bit more while you’re tossing them in the sauce. This way you’ll have perfectly al dente noodles.</li>
	<li><strong>Make the sauce.</strong> In a pan, heat up the butter over low heat. Add the garlic and cook until soft. Stir in the crushed red pepper, then the brown sugar and soy sauce.</li>
	<li><strong>Toss.</strong> Add the drained noodles to the pan, turn up the heat, and toss to coat.</li>
	<li><strong>Cook the egg.</strong> Push the noodles to one side and add an egg to the pan and scramble until just set.</li>
	<li><strong>Serve.</strong> Place the noodles in a bowl and finish with sliced scallions and everything bagel spice. Enjoy hot!
</li>

<h2>Tiktok Ramen Ingredients</h2>
<p><strong>instant ramen</strong> – choose your favorite brand of instant ramen. The flavor doesn’t matter because you’re not going to use the seasoning packet. Our favorite noodles are Nong Shim Shin Ramyun because of how thick the noodles are.</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>butter</strong> – just bit of butter is melted down to cook up some garlic.</li>
	<li><strong>garlic</strong> – you need about 1 teaspoon of chopped or minced garlic. Or, if you’re a garlic lover, use as many cloves as you can handle.</li>
	<li><strong>brown sugar</strong> – the brown sugar adds a bit of caramel sweetness and color. If you don’t have brown sugar, you can use regular sugar or even honey.</li>
	<li><strong>soy sauce</strong> – use your favorite soy sauce – I like Yamasa or Kikkoman.</li>
	<li><strong>crushed red pepper flakes</strong> – you can add as many chili flakes as you like or leave them out all together, depending on your spice tolerance.</li>
	<li><strong>egg</strong> – throw an egg on it because ramen without an egg isn’t even ramen.</li>
</ul>
